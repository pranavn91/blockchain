abstract = "Blockchain, as one of the crypto-intensive creatures, has become a very hot topic recently. Although many surveys have recently been dedicated to the security and privacy issues of blockchains, there still lacks a systematic examination on the cryptographic primitives in blockchains. To this end, we in this paper conduct a systematic study on the cryptographic primitives in blockchains by comprehensive analysis on top-30 mainstream cryptocurrencies, in terms of the usages, functionalities, and evolutions of these primitives. We hope that it would be helpful for cryptographers who are going to devote themselves to the blockchain research, and the financial engineers/managers who want to evaluate cryptographic solutions for blockchain-based projects."

abstract = "Blockchain, as a decentralized and distributed public ledger technology in peer-to-peer network, has received considerable attention recently. It applies a linked block structure to verify and store data, and applies the trusted consensus mechanism to synchronize changes in data, which makes it possible to create a tamper-proof digital platform for storing and sharing data. It is believed that blockchain can be utilized in diverse Internet interactive systems (e.g., Internet of Things, supply chain systems, identity management, and so on). However, there are some privacy challenges that may hinder the applications of blockchain. The goal of this survey is to provide some insights into the privacy issues associated with blockchain. We analyze the privacy threats in blockchain and discuss existing cryptographic defense mechanisms, i.e., anonymity and transaction privacy preservation. Furthermore, we summarize some typical implementations of privacy preservation mechanisms in blockchain and explore future research challenges that still need to be addressed in order to preserve privacy when blockchain is used."

abstract = "Since the success of Bitcoin, there have been increased focus of studying the application of blockchain in a broad range of applications, such as in solutions facilitating identity privacy and transaction security using a decentralized architecture via different consensus mechanisms (e.g. proof-of-work) between different geo-located IoT devices/nodes in our increasingly digitalized society (e.g. smart city). In this paper, we survey the usage of blockchain technology for smart communities, focusing on key components of the blockchain applications. We also study the various process models used in the execution of secure transactions. Specifically, we present a detailed taxonomy on the applications, process models used, and communication infrastructure support needed to execute various applications."
