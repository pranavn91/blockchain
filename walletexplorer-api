All parameters are mandatory. Parameter "caller" is whatever string do you want and it's used for personal statistics only.
Result has always key "found" (boolean), or "error" (string, in case of bad input).
Paging may be only by 100 items as I have fixed indexes in data files (so it's most efficient). There could be an option to get less results in future.
Wallets can be searched by id, by label or by some variant of label (e.g. "bitstamp" instead of "Bitstamp.net"). That's pretty mess now :-)
There's no way to get a type of label (exchange, service etc.) yet.
Documentation is also not available yet.

You can download 1 request/sec - there is some speed limiter on server configuration, if you will download faster, it will ban you for 1 hour (sorry but there were a lot of downloaders and the server was almost unusable for all).
